# EVConneXion
EVConneXion helps electric vehicle users in the UK find the nearest charge point to their location.

Find and use data on public electric vehicle chargepoints using the National Chargepoint Registry (NCR) on public electric vehicle chargepoints in the UK.

- This will be a portfolio app that I develop in public. 
- I will document each stage as I go through the design, build and test of the project.
