# EVChargePoints
Find and use data on public electric vehicle chargepoints using the National Chargepoint Registry (NCR) on public electric vehicle chargepoints in the UK.

- This will be a portfolio app that I develop in public. 
- I will document each stage as I go through the design, build and test of the project.

### MVP
- Get locations nearest to user by current location of postcode
- Display locations on map
- Each location should include info about charger type and any other relative info
- Distance to location
- Add ability to 'favourite' a chargepoint
- more tbc
